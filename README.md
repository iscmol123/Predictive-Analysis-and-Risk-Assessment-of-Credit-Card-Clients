# Predictive-Analysis-and-Risk-Assessment-of-Credit-Card-Clients

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of credit card clients using the UCI Credit Card dataset. The objective is to develop predictive models to assess the risk and predict the likelihood of default among credit card holders. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing credit risk and develop robust models to aid financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding credit approvals and risk management. â€‹
